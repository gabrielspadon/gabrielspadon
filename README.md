### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Spadon. I have a Ph.D. and MSc. in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo - Brazil. Part of my Ph.D. was at the Georgia Institute of Technology - USA. After that, I joined Dalhousie University - Halifax, NS - Canada, for a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Institute for Big Data Analytics, co-hosted by Oceanix at IMT Atlantique - Brest, Brittany - France. Since the start of my graduate studies, I have worked with Network Science and Artificial Intelligence and published several research articles on topics of knowledge discovery through complex networks and data mining. Currently, I'm interested in neural-inspired models, graph-based deep learning, and complex network dynamics applied to transdisciplinary topics, such as human behavior and ocean sciences. ðŸŒ±
