### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Spadon. I have a Ph.D. and MSc. in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo - Brazil. Part of my Ph.D. was at the Georgia Institute of Technology - USA, and after that I engaged in a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Dalhousie University - Canada. I have worked with Network Science and Artificial Intelligence and published several research articles on topics of knowledge discovery through complex networks and data mining. I'm currently interested in neural-inspired models, graph-based deep learning, and complex network dynamics mainly applied to transdisciplinary topics, such as urban planning, human behavior, and ocean and environmental sciences. ðŸŒ±
