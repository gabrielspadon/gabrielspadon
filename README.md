### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Big Data Analytics (IBDA) at Dalhousie University (DAL), Canada, co-hosted by the Oceanix group at IMT Atlantique, France. I have a Ph.D. and an MSc from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with part of my doctoral research undertaken at the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. I am longstanding involved in Data Science and Engineering, GeoInformatics, and Machine Learning. My research focuses on spatio-temporal data modeling, time-series forecasting, complex network analysis, and physics-informed neural networks, with interest in mobility-related problems.
