### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Spadon. I have a Ph.D. and MSc. in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo - Brazil. Part of my Ph.D. was at the Georgia Institute of Technology - USA, and after that, I joined Dalhousie University - Halifax, NS - Canada for a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Institute for Big Data Analytics, co-hosted by Oceanix at IMT Atlantique - Brest, Brittany - France. I have worked with Network Science and Artificial Intelligence and published several research articles on topics of knowledge discovery through complex networks and data mining. I'm currently interested in neural-inspired models, graph-based deep learning, and complex network dynamics applied to transdisciplinary topics, such as urban planning, human behavior, and ocean/environmental sciences. ðŸŒ±
